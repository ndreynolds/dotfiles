To install:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Clone the repo from ~:

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/ndreynolds/.vim.git

The recursive flag will pull in all the plugins which I have stored
as Git submodules.

My .vimrc is also included within the repository. I prefer to keep it
packaged with the .vim stuff and link it on my machines like so:

    $ ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vim
